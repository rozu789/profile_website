            <p>Hi, I’m Rose, I’m 17 years old, and I’m from Nootdorp. I’ve always had a passion for things that allow me to dive into different worlds and experiences. 
                Video games are a huge part of that, especially Red Dead Redemption II and Subnautica. Both games are so well-crafted, with incredible attention to detail and a sense of adventure that I love. 
                I can easily spend hours just exploring every corner of their worlds, getting lost in the storylines and the atmosphere. Outside of gaming, I’ve always been drawn to design, it’s something I find really exciting, whether it’s creating new 
                concepts or playing around with different visual styles. It’s all about experimenting and finding new ways to express creativity. <br> <br>

                I’m really into films that leave a lasting impression or make me think. I enjoy a variety of genres, from psychological thrillers like The Silence of the Lambs, which has such a gripping atmosphere and unforgettable 
                characters, to sci-fi films like Annihilation, which blends beautiful visuals with deeper existential themes. I also enjoy horror films with a more unsettling vibe, like Speak No Evil (2022), which sticks with you long after the credits roll. 
                And of course, I’ve always been a fan of Star Wars, it’s a classic that I appreciate for its storytelling and the vast, immersive universe it creates. 
                Overall, I’m drawn to movies that offer something more than just entertainment, whether it’s a complex narrative, strong characters, or thought-provoking themes.</p>
