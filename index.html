            <h2>My motivation</h2>
            <p>
                I believe ICT is a great fit fo rme because it connects with so many things I've been passionate about since I was young,
                especially problem-solving, technology, and video games. From the time i was in elementry school all the way through highschool, 
                math was always my favorite subject. I loved and still love sitting down with a problem and taking it apart until i figure out how to fix it.
                Video games played a huge role in sparking my interest in tech. I've always loved playing them but the older I got the more interested I got  into how
                they actaully work. That thought prossess led me to think about not just video games but how every aspect of computers work.Even though i 
                was already curious i didn't do a whole lot of research into it, but when I took computer class as a subject in highschool i realized
                that this was actaully something i found interesting enough to do for a long time. Other than math, it was the first time i found myself
                actually excited to work on school projects.        
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, I've never really doubted that ICT was going to be the right fit for me, and i still don't. As im writing this ive already been
                going to school for  a few weeks now and i still find working on checkpoints, workshops and week project super interesting. Even when i get stuck
                on an excersize it just makes me more eager to finish the puzzel. I'm excited to keep improving my skills and figure out how i can use those skills
                in my future.
