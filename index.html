            <h2>Motivatie voor ICT</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Roos Hogervorst, and I’m currently in my first year studying Information and Communication Technology (ICT). 
                My passion for video games, like Red Dead Redemption II, really got me interested in how all the tech and systems work behind the scenes to 
                create such immersive worlds. It made me curious about the deeper layers of technology—how software and hardware come together to make everything tick. <br><br>
                This curiosity was only strengthened during high school, especially in my favorite subject, informatica, where I loved solving coding challenges, figuring 
                out how systems operate, and just diving into the details of computer science. ICT feels like a natural fit for me because it combines my love for 
                problem-solving, creativity, and all things tech. Now that I’ve started my studies, I’m even more excited about the possibilities in this field, 
                from software development to AI and beyond. I’m really looking forward to continuing this journey and gaining the skills I need to make a real difference 
                in the world of technology.</p>
