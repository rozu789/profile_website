        <p id="programmingExperience">
          Before comming here to HZ to study ICT the only real experience i had with coding and computers was from Computer sience 
          class druing highschool. In those 2 years we learned mostly about sorting algorithms, hexadecimal, binary and the fysical components
          of a computer such as a GPU. As for coding we learned very basic html during the first half of the first year. The rest of the 
          time we worked with Pyton.
